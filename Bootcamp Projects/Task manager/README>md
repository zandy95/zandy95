## Task Manager 1st Capstone Project

### Description
In this project I developed a Python-based task management program for a small business to efficiently track and assign tasks to team members. 
The program includes an administrative interface for adding new tasks and generating detailed statistics on task completion and team performance. 

### Installation and usage
Download and run the "task_manager.py", "tasks.txt" and "user.txt"file and follow the instructions on the terminal.
